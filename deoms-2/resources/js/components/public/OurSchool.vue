                            Lately in year 1967, a man stood in the midst of pressures and hectic schedules of being a businessman. 
                            His heart craved for an intense desire to help the poor. He sought ideas and advises from families and 
                            friends at Colegio del San Jose in Misamis Oriental. Thus in 1968, a proposal to open a private 
                            institution was passed, God was with him that it was approved.
